<h1 align="center">📗 Add Bulma to Svelte</h1>

## ❓ What is this?
This is an **experimental** command to run to add Bulma to your SvelteKit project.

## 🛠 Usage
You must start with a fresh copy of the official SvelteKit template, which is currently created by running this command:
```sh
npm init svelte@next
```

Once that is set up, run this command in your project directory to set up Bulma:
```sh
npx svelte-add bulma
```

After the preset runs,
* You can use Bulma utility classes like `is-primary` or `mb-3` in the markup (components, routes, `app.html`).

* You can modify your design in `src/global.scss` and in example add `$body-background-color: blue;` above the import statements. Make sure to also check out [Bulma Docs](https://bulma.io/documentation/customize/variables/) for all configuration options!

* You can apply *another* [Svelte Adder](https://github.com/svelte-add/svelte-adders) to your project for more functionality.
